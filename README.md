I developed a concurrent client/server application for interplanetary distances, enabling text message exchange with time delays of several minutes or more. The project involved adapting communication protocols and paradigms for long-distance messaging, using tools and resources from NASA (www.nasa.gov). I utilized C, Linux, and computer networking concepts, along with TCP protocols, to simulate interplanetary communication and demonstrate its functionality using one of NASAâ€™s proposed scenarios.
